# Zway-InfluxDb2Stats

Store sensor data in InfluxDB instances. Sensor and device data is transfered
periodically, as well as every time a change occurs.

Since this module uses the new line protocol, it requires at least InfluxDb
version 0.9.0.

Data is stored under 'device.$DeviceID$', with only one measurement key
called 'level' The following tags are also added:

* probe: Probe title (eg. 'temperature')
* room: Room name
* scale: Scale title (eg. 'Â°C')
* type: Basic device type (eg. 'multilevelSensor')
* title: Device name

# Installation

Install the BaseModule from https://github.com/maros/Zway-BaseModule first.
You will also need access to a working InfluxDB instance. See
https://influxdata.com/get-started/download-and-install-influxdb/ for
installation instructions.

The prefered way of installing this module is via the "Zwave.me App Store"
available in 2.2.0 and higher. For stable module releases no access token is
required. If you want to test the latest pre-releases use 'k1_beta' as
app store access token.

For developers and users of older Zway versions installation via git is
recommended.

```shell
cd /opt/z-way-server/automation/userModules
git clone https://github.com/maros/Zway-InfluxDbStats.git InfluxDbStats --branch latest
```

To update or install a specific version
```shell
cd /opt/z-way-server/automation/userModules/InfluxDbStats
git fetch --tags
# For latest released version
git checkout tags/latest
# For a specific version
git checkout tags/1.02
# For development version
git checkout -b master --track origin/master
```
